## Usage

### Basic Usage

Generate a resume for a specific job posting:

```bash
npm start generate --job-url "https://example.com/job-posting" --resume ./examples/resume.txt
```

### Advanced Usage

Include your websites and social profiles for more comprehensive data:

```bash
npm start generate \
  --job-url "https://example.com/job-posting" \
  --resume ./examples/resume.json \
  --websites "https://myportfolio.com" "https://myblog.com" \
  --social "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" "https://github.com/yourusername" \
  --output ./output/my-targeted-resume.txt
```

### Command Line Options

- `-j, --job-url <url>` (required): URL of the job posting you're applying to
- `-r, --resume <path>`: Path to your current resume (JSON or text format)
- `-w, --websites <urls...>`: Your personal websites or portfolio URLs (space-separated)
- `-s, --social <profiles...>`: Your social profile URLs like LinkedIn, GitHub (space-separated)
- `-o, --output <path>`: Output file path (default: `./output/resume.txt`)

### Examples

Using the example resume files:

```bash
# Using JSON resume
npm start generate \
  --job-url "https://jobs.example.com/position" \
  --resume ./examples/resume.json

# Using text resume with websites
npm start generate \
  --job-url "https://jobs.example.com/position" \
  --resume ./examples/resume.txt \
  --websites "https://mysite.com"

# Complete example with all options
npm start generate \
  --job-url "https://jobs.example.com/senior-developer" \
  --resume ./examples/resume.json \
  --websites "https://portfolio.example.com" \
  --social "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe" "https://github.com/johndoe" \
  --output ./output/senior-dev-resume.txt
```

## Input Formats

### Resume Files

The application supports two resume formats:

**JSON Format** (see `examples/resume.json`):
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "summary": "...",
  "experience": [...],
  "education": [...],
  "skills": [...]
}
```

**Text Format** (see `examples/resume.txt`):
Plain text resume with your information formatted as you prefer.

## How It Works

1. **Job Analysis**: Scrapes the job posting URL to extract requirements, skills, and job details
2. **Data Gathering**: Optionally scrapes your websites and social profiles for additional context
3. **Resume Loading**: Loads your existing resume from the provided file
4. **Intelligent Matching**: Identifies skills and requirements that match the job posting
5. **Resume Generation**: Creates a targeted resume highlighting relevant experience and skills
6. **Output**: Saves the generated resume to the specified output path

## Output

The generated resume includes:
- Target position information
- Relevant skills matching the job posting
- Your professional background from existing resume
- Online presence (websites)
- Professional profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- Job requirements to address
- Generation timestamp

## Environment Variables

Optional environment variables can be set in a `.env` file:

```bash
DEBUG=true              # Enable debug logging
HEADLESS=true          # Run browser in headless mode (default)
BROWSER_TIMEOUT=30000  # Browser timeout in milliseconds
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Chromium browser (installed via Playwright)

## Development

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch

## Troubleshooting

```

### Network Errors
